Description:
We all love music, but when we read the lyrics, the message can be lost. Using everything that we now know about fonts and their styling you will need to style the text to represent the emotion behind the lyrics!
Instructions:
Please read and follow the instructions below:
1. Pick a song that you love and get the lyrics. This will be the content for your webpage.
2. Using HTML structure the content using the appropriate semantic elements.
3. Add enough CSS to make the HTML structure have a pleasant appearance.
4. Use at least two different fonts. These can be custom fonts or Google fonts.
